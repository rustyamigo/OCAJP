4.3 Array

4.3.1 What is an array?

An array is an object that stores a collection of values. It stores references to the data it stores. 

Arrays can store two types of data:
1. A collection of primitive data types
2. A collection of objects 

An array of primitive values stores primitive values themselves.
An array of objects stores a collection of values, which are in fact heap-memory addresses or pointers.

Ex: - ArrayEx01

In Java, one can define one-dimensional and multidimensional arrays. 
A one-dimensional array is an object that refers to a collection of scalar values.
A two-dimensional (or more) array is referred to as multidimensional array. 
A two dimensional array refers to a collection of objects in which each of the objects is a one-dimensional array. Similary a three dimensional array refers to a collection of two-dimensional arrays, and so on.
NOTE: a two dimensional arrays may or may not contain the same number of elements.

Creating an array involves three steps 
1. Declaring an array
2. Allocating the array
3. Initializing the array elements.

4.3.2. Array Declaration


[9.4] Declare and use an ArrayList of a given type.
---------------------------------------------------
ArrayList is one of the most widely used classes from the Collections framework. It offers the best combination of features offered by an array and the List data structures.
The most commonly used operations with a list are : 
1. add items to a list
2. modify items in a list
3. delete items from a list
4. & iterate over the items.

An ArrayList can be compared with a resizable array.
